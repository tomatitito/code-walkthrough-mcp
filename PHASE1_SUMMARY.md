# Phase 1 Implementation Summary

## Overview

Successfully implemented Phase 1 of the Git Commit Video Walkthrough MCP Server according to the specification and implementation plan. This phase establishes the core sampling-based architecture where the tool orchestrates the agent through MCP's sampling capability.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Core Architecture (Inverted Flow Pattern)

**New MCP Server with Sampling** (`src/index.ts`)
- Declares `sampling` capability in server capabilities
- Implements single `generate_walkthrough` tool (replaces 6 legacy tools)
- Orchestrates multi-stage workflow via sequential sampling requests
- Manages conversation state within tool execution
- Handles commit, staged, and unstaged analysis (codebase deferred to Phase 2)

### 2. Type System (`src/types/`)

**state.ts** - State management types
- `WalkthroughState`: Tracks execution across stages
- `TargetSpec`: Defines what to analyze (commit/staged/unstaged/codebase)
- `PresentationStyle`: beginner/technical/overview
- `Theme`: dark/light/github
- `AnalysisResult`: Structured agent analysis output
- `ScriptResult`: Structured script generation output

**analysis.ts** - Analysis data types
- `CommitInfo`: Git commit metadata and changes
- `FileChange`: Individual file modifications
- `DiffInfo`: Staged/unstaged change information
- `CodebaseInfo`: Whole codebase structure (for Phase 2)

**script.ts** - Script generation types
- `VideoScript`: Complete narration script
- `ScriptSection`: Per-file narration segments
- `NarrationTiming`: Time-synchronized content

### 3. Data Extraction Layer (`src/extractors/`)

**commit.ts** - Git operations
- `extractCommitInfo()`: Parse commit metadata and diffs
- `extractStagedChanges()`: Get index changes
- `extractUnstagedChanges()`: Get working directory changes
- Handles initial commits, binary files, and edge cases
- Uses `simple-git` for reliable git operations

### 4. Sampling Stages (`src/stages/`)

**analysis.ts** - Agent analysis via sampling
- `requestCommitAnalysis()`: Prompts agent to analyze commits
- `requestDiffAnalysis()`: Prompts agent to analyze diffs
- `requestCodebaseAnalysis()`: Stub for Phase 2
- Robust JSON parsing with markdown code block handling
- Comprehensive error handling and validation

**script.ts** - Script generation via sampling
- `requestScriptGeneration()`: Prompts agent for narration
- Parses and validates script response
- Handles different presentation styles
- Extracts full narrative with pause markers

### 5. Prompt Engineering (`src/utils/prompts.ts`)

**Sophisticated Prompt Templates**
- `generateCommitAnalysisPrompt()`: Instructs agent on commit analysis
- `generateDiffAnalysisPrompt()`: Instructs agent on diff analysis
- `generateCodebaseAnalysisPrompt()`: Template for Phase 2
- `generateScriptPrompt()`: Instructs agent on script generation

**Key Features:**
- Explicitly instructs agents to use subagents when available
- Enforces strict JSON response format
- Provides style-specific guidance (beginner/technical/overview)
- Includes examples and clear requirements
- Prevents common formatting issues (markdown blocks)

### 6. Testing Infrastructure

**Integration Test** (`tests/integration-test.ts`)
- Validates type system integrity
- Tests commit extraction from real repository
- Verifies prompt generation
- Confirms all modules load correctly
- Ensures server instantiation works

**Test Results:** ✓ All 5 tests passed

## Architecture Highlights

### Inverted Conversation Flow

**Traditional MCP Pattern (Old):**
```
Agent → calls tool_1 → returns data
Agent → calls tool_2 → returns data
Agent → calls tool_3 → returns data
```

**Sampling Pattern (New):**
```
Tool → prompts agent (sampling) → receives analysis
Tool → prompts agent (sampling) → receives script
Tool → generates video → returns result
```

### Multi-Stage Workflow

1. **Initialization**: Validate inputs, extract target content
2. **Analysis Stage**: Agent analyzes code via sampling
3. **Script Stage**: Agent generates narration via sampling
4. **Video Stage**: Tool generates frames/audio/video (Phase 3)

### State Management

State lives within a single tool execution:
- `WalkthroughState` tracks progress through stages
- Sequential sampling requests build up state
- Error handling preserves partial results
- Clear stage transitions (analysis → script → video → complete)

**Total New Code:** ~859 lines (including old files retained)

## Key Design Decisions

### 1. Sampling Over Direct Execution

**Why:** The spec requires agents to perform code analysis, which necessitates file reading and intelligent interpretation that agents excel at.

**How:** MCP sampling allows the tool to request work from the agent, inverting the traditional flow.

### 2. Structured JSON Responses

**Why:** Ensures predictable, parseable output from agents.

**How:** Prompts explicitly require JSON format with schema. Parser handles markdown code blocks gracefully.

### 3. Subagent Delegation in Prompts

**Why:** Spec requires instructing agents to use subagents when available.

**How:** Every prompt includes guidance: "If you have access to subagents or the Task tool, delegate this analysis..."

### 4. Presentation Style Variants

**Why:** Different audiences need different levels of detail.

**How:** Style parameter affects both analysis depth and narration pacing.

### 5. Phase-Based Implementation

**Why:** Reduces risk, enables incremental testing.

**How:** Phase 1 focuses on sampling architecture. Video generation deferred to Phase 3.

## Deviations from Plan

### Implemented Ahead of Schedule
- None - followed plan exactly

### Deferred to Later Phases
- **Codebase analysis**: Requires file enumeration (Phase 2)
- **Video generation**: Frame/audio/compilation (Phase 3)
- **Visual themes**: Full theme support (Phase 3)

### Minor Adjustments
- Added robust JSON parsing with markdown block stripping
- Enhanced error messages for better debugging
- Included integration test in Phase 1 (originally Phase 5)

## Testing Results

```
Test 1: Type definitions are accessible          ✓ PASSED
Test 2: Extract commit info from current repo    ✓ PASSED
Test 3: Verify prompt generation                 ✓ PASSED
Test 4: Verify all stage modules load            ✓ PASSED
Test 5: Verify server can be instantiated        ✓ PASSED

Results: 5/5 tests passed (100%)
```

## Known Limitations (Phase 1)

1. **No video output yet**: Video generation stubbed, returns analysis + script only
2. **Codebase analysis not implemented**: `type: "codebase"` throws not-implemented error
3. **No MCP client testing**: Full sampling integration requires running MCP client
4. **Error recovery**: No retry logic for failed sampling requests
5. **Token limits**: No handling of responses exceeding max_tokens

## Next Steps (Phase 2 & 3)

### Phase 2: Input Type Support
- [ ] Implement codebase file enumeration
- [ ] Add `.gitignore` respecting file walker
- [ ] Support multiple languages in codebase analysis
- [ ] Create codebase-specific prompts

### Phase 3: Video Generation
- [ ] Generate HTML frames from analysis
- [ ] Implement syntax highlighting
- [ ] Integrate Edge TTS for audio
- [ ] Compile video with FFmpeg
- [ ] Add timing synchronization

## How to Test

### Build the Project
```bash
cd /Volumes/sourcecode/personal/code-walkthrough-mcp
bun run build:tsc
```

### Run Integration Tests
```bash
bun tests/integration-test.ts
```

### Test with MCP Inspector (Recommended)
```bash
# Install MCP Inspector
npm install -g @modelcontextprotocol/inspector

# Run server with inspector
mcp-inspector bun dist/src/index.js
```

### Expected Behavior
1. Server declares `sampling` capability
2. `generate_walkthrough` tool appears in tool list
3. Calling tool with commit triggers two sampling requests:
   - First: Agent analyzes commit
   - Second: Agent generates script
4. Tool returns JSON with analysis, script, and stub video status
